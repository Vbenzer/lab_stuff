Bugs: (Sorted by priority)

- Gui bugs:
    - choose folder button deactivated after being on general tab... (cant reproduce- maybe fixed?)
    - Gui layout doesnt stay still... but only in lab (minor bug)


Additions: (Sorted by priority)

- Add to gui:
    - qol stuff: make sure no folder is overwritten
        - make sure that analysis dependencies are enforced

- Incorporate Thorcam or way to check input output cam as live feed in Gui (partly done)

- Same with Qhyccd, also check for max value and way to easily change exposure time in GUI
    - Problem with that: Hot pixel mask necessary
    - Add a way to change the exposure time in the GUI

- Rewrite everything that uses nina to work directly with python:
    - Then add way to easily check and change exposure time in GUI

- Rethink the plot all option for all measurements... maybe add a way to select which measurements to plot

Ideas:
- Potentially test faster fps with qhyccd for tiptilt with https://github.com/JiangXL/qhyccd-python/blob/master/QHYCCD_Demo.ipynb

- For more complex fiber shapes add a custom feature where the user can trace the fiber shape around the fiber image
    the mask can then be scaled and used for the calculations
- Potentially change position handling on images for pixels to float, pixel grid to center of pixel
- Add number of positions as input for the measurements in the GUI for sg
