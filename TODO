Bugs: (Sorted by priority)

- Gui bugs:

    - minor bugs:
        - Gui layout doesnt stay still... but only in lab



Additions: (Sorted by priority)
- Group meeting:
    - More images in report
    - avila 3. april

- try log scale for sg input images

- Add exp time input for sg

- Add index system for fibers (i guess just smoothly transition to no naming convention)

- Rework plots, especially frd sutherland plot numbers are hardly readable change so the float atop
    - Add horizontal cut illumination plot for frd and sg bc why not (done but noticed weird background in sg)

- Rethink the plot all option for all measurements... maybe add a way to select which measurements to plot

- Add to gui:
    - qol stuff:
        - make sure that analysis dependencies are enforced


Ideas:
- Add numbering system for fibers

- Option to set expo time to recommended value for the measurement

- Automatically assist with some of the checks, E.g. for frd: Opens thorcam then asks is there the fiber is it oriented horizontally and so on...

- Darks in frd are dependant on the position

- Potentially test faster fps with qhyccd for tip tilt with https://github.com/JiangXL/qhyccd-python/blob/master/QHYCCD_Demo.ipynb

- For more complex fiber shapes add a custom feature where the user can trace the fiber shape around the fiber image
    the mask can then be scaled and used for the calculations
- Potentially change position handling on images for pixels to float, pixel grid to center of pixel
- Add number of positions as input for the measurements in the GUI for sg
