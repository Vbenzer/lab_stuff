Bugs: (Sorted by priority)

- Gui bugs:
    - fiber dimension sometimes resets to weird values (cant reproduce)
    - Weird spacer behavior in general tab
    - Update button accessibility

    - minor bugs:
        - Gui layout doesnt stay still... but only in lab



Additions: (Sorted by priority)
- Group meeting:
    - Shake fiber input for sg improvement?
    - Cerium oxide for fiber polishing

- test c_100_0001 and 0002 to improve sg code

- Change nf_ff to constant trim for both entrance and exit (not sure if necessary)

- Add functions to GUI:
    - Horizontal cuts (done, not tested)
    - nf ff stuff (done, not tested)
    - fiber size measurement (done, not tested)

- Rework sg com and comk plots (done mostly)
    - sg entrance spot position probably biased

- try log scale for sg input images (not sure if that makes a difference for the image detection or differentiation of spot and fiber face)

- Rethink the plot all option for all measurements... maybe add a way to select which measurements to plot

- Add to gui:
    - qol stuff:
        - add general way to choose frd calibration da
        - make sure that analysis dependencies are enforced (visually also with indentations)


Ideas:
- Add logs to the GUI (to better reproduce bugs)

- Option to set expo time to recommended value for the measurement

- Automatically assist with some of the checks, E.g. for frd: Opens thorcam then asks is there the fiber is it oriented horizontally and so on...

- Potentially test faster fps with qhyccd for tip tilt with https://github.com/JiangXL/qhyccd-python/blob/master/QHYCCD_Demo.ipynb

- For more complex fiber shapes add a custom feature where the user can trace the fiber shape around the fiber image
    the mask can then be scaled and used for the calculations
- Potentially change position handling on images for pixels to float, pixel grid to center of pixel
- Add number of positions as input for the measurements in the GUI for sg
