Bugs: (Sorted by priority)

- Gui bugs:

    - minor bugs:
        - Gui layout doesnt stay still... but only in lab

TODOs from report:
    - FRD with all filters
    - Nicer report

- implement check that counts are in linear regime ~35k counts

- input beam profile doesnt look great with pinholes
    - maybe move pinhole back for better fratio filterwheel coverage and more space at fiber input
- better sg_min calculation, compare sg c_100 and o_89
- for sg exit plot instead of dot exaggeration maybe just an arrow doing the same thing
- center of mass calculation utilizes binary as input (sensible???)

- theoretically possible to do all measurements without changing the fiber position
    - throughput with combination of photodiode and camera (like in that one paper)
    - far and near field at output beamsplitter

Additions: (Sorted by priority)
- Group meeting:
    - Shake fiber input for sg improvement?
    - Cerium oxide for fiber polishing

- test c_100_0001 and 0002 to improve sg code, circle detection could be better in frd also (done)
    - must check system measurements: Circles fits are bad (this is done)
    - c_100 frds are influenced by background light

- For sg: Check if motor precision for displacement of fiber face is acceptable to use as base for entrance fiber position values
    - For this there would have to be one calibration image so maybe not feasible...
    - But perhaps useful for better precision of the sg input image


- Change nf_ff to constant trim for both entrance and exit (not sure if necessary)
    - Give options to change driving width for input spot (done, not completely tested)
    - Also give options if trim should be in log scale or not


- Rethink the plot all option for all measurements... maybe add a way to select which measurements to plot

- Add to gui:
    - qol stuff:
        - make sure that analysis dependencies are enforced (visually also with indentations)


Ideas:
- try log scale for sg input images (not sure if that makes a difference for the image detection or differentiation of spot and fiber face)

- Add logs to the GUI (to better reproduce bugs)(done)

- Option to set expo time to recommended value for the measurement

- Automatically assist with some of the checks, E.g. for frd: Opens thorcam then asks is there the fiber is it oriented horizontally and so on...

- Potentially test faster fps with qhyccd for tip tilt with https://github.com/JiangXL/qhyccd-python/blob/master/QHYCCD_Demo.ipynb

- For more complex fiber shapes add a custom feature where the user can trace the fiber shape around the fiber image
    the mask can then be scaled and used for the calculations
- Potentially change position handling on images for pixels to float, pixel grid to center of pixel
- Add number of positions as input for the measurements in the GUI for sg

Done:
- For sg:
    - maybe work with region props and lowest eccentricity or so (not really possible i think basically only edge
        detection really works, or at least something else based on gradients)

    - Also for this, let com of spot be constant, shouldn't move in the first place (done, well set to median)
        - Also for comk of exit

    - Also reworked circle detection for entrance images (should be better now)
            - Changed params for circle detection
