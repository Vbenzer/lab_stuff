Bugs: (Sorted by priority)

- Gui bugs:
    - Gui layout doesnt stay still... but only in lab (minor bug)


Additions: (Sorted by priority)
- Incorporate Thorcam or way to check input output cam as live feed in Gui (all done except live)

- Rewrite everything that uses nina to work directly with python: (rewrite done new fct)
    - Then add way to easily check and change exposure time in GUI (not done)

- Rethink the plot all option for all measurements... maybe add a way to select which measurements to plot

- Add to gui:
    - qol stuff:
        - make selection tools for coating type and manufacturer

        - make sure that analysis dependencies are enforced


Ideas:

- Automatically assist with some of the checks, E.g. for frd: Opens thorcam then asks is there the fiber is it oriented horizontally and so on...

- Darks in frd are dependant on the position

- Potentially test faster fps with qhyccd for tiptilt with https://github.com/JiangXL/qhyccd-python/blob/master/QHYCCD_Demo.ipynb

- For more complex fiber shapes add a custom feature where the user can trace the fiber shape around the fiber image
    the mask can then be scaled and used for the calculations
- Potentially change position handling on images for pixels to float, pixel grid to center of pixel
- Add number of positions as input for the measurements in the GUI for sg
