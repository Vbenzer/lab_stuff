Bugs: (Sorted by priority)

- Gui bugs:
    - not sure how to reproduce but fiber dimension sometimes resets to weird values
    - checking existing measurements doesnt work
    - can run measure system fratio without folder


    - minor bugs:
        - Gui layout doesnt stay still... but only in lab



Additions: (Sorted by priority)
- Group meeting:
    -
- Change nf_ff to constant trim for both entrance and exit

- Add images to show nf ff with different spot positions

- try log scale for sg input images

- Rethink the plot all option for all measurements... maybe add a way to select which measurements to plot

- Add to gui:
    - qol stuff:
        - add general way to choose frd calibration da
        - make sure that analysis dependencies are enforced


Ideas:
- Option to set expo time to recommended value for the measurement

- Automatically assist with some of the checks, E.g. for frd: Opens thorcam then asks is there the fiber is it oriented horizontally and so on...

- Darks in frd are dependant on the position

- Potentially test faster fps with qhyccd for tip tilt with https://github.com/JiangXL/qhyccd-python/blob/master/QHYCCD_Demo.ipynb

- For more complex fiber shapes add a custom feature where the user can trace the fiber shape around the fiber image
    the mask can then be scaled and used for the calculations
- Potentially change position handling on images for pixels to float, pixel grid to center of pixel
- Add number of positions as input for the measurements in the GUI for sg
