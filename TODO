Additions: (Sorted by priority)

- Add to gui:
    - control of f-number wheel (done but not perfect yet: change so that is only activated if you want to change it)
    - also add: qol stuff:
        - current f-number

- Add way to upload results (and maybe also rawdata) to labshare server -> maybe add a way to do that in the GUI


- Make plots with visualisation of the input and output f-number (done but not in gui yet)

- Incorporate Thorcam or way to check input output cam as live feed in Gui
- Same with Qhyccd, also check for max value and way to easily change exposure time in GUI
    - Problem with that: Hot pixel mask necessary
  - Add a way to change the exposure time in the GUI

- Rethink the plot all option for all measurements... maybe add a way to select which measurements to plot
- Think about a way to make the analysis of the raw data possible from everywhere
